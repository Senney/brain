# Distributed Systems

Generally easier to  build a system **non-distributed.**

## Why distribute?
- [[fault-tolerance]]
  - [[replication]]
- [[Parallelism]]
- [[Security]] and isolation
- [[Performance]]
## Challenges
- Concurrency
- Handling partial failure
- Getting real [[performance]] out of the system.
- "Split brain"
  - Generally caused by network partition errors, e.g. a "master" cannot talk to a server, but clients can reach that server.

Distributed systems are [[infrastructure]]. They are generally abstractions
which give simpler interfaces to complicated problems. 

## Implementation

### Examples of implementation methods
- RPC, threads, concurrency

### MapReduce

See [[distributed-systems-map-reduce]].

### Google File System (GFS)

See [[distributed-systems-gfs]]

### Threads

See [[threads]]

### Raft

See [[Raft]]
