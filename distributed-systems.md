# Distributed Systems

Generally easier to  build a system **non-distributed.**

## Why distribute?
- [[fault-tolerance]]
- [[Parallelism]]
- [[Security]] and isolation
- [[Performance]]
## Challenges
- Concurrency
- Handling partial failure
- Getting real [[performance]] out of the system.

Distributed systems are [[infrastructure]]. They are generally abstractions
which give simpler interfaces to complicated problems. 

## Implementation

### Examples of implementation methods
- RPC, threads, concurrency

### MapReduce

See [[distributed-systems-map-reduce]].

### Google File System (GFS)

### Threads
